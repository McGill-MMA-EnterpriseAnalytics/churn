# TelCo Customer Churn Prediction

The core objective is predicting customer churn behavior for the TelCo Company. 

TelCo Company currently has no data-driven and quantitatively-based prediction model. Our team will develop machine learning models, using a 7043-observation (customer) with 20 predictors dataset. 

The model will be a supervised, binary classification model, since we have a clear binary target variable, churn or no churn. To achieve the optimal outcome, our team will both manually build machine learning models in Python and develop an Auto Machine Learning Model in H20.ai. 

The core performance will be measured in terms of the accuracy and F1 Score.  

Our model will be used by the marketing and consumer retention team so that they could intervene early by either offering targeted online offers and coupons, or having representatives phoning those consumers who are predicted to churn. 

Also, the model explainability report will be used by middle-level managers to gain insights on the factor that both positively and negatively contribute to the churn rate so they could address such factors accordingly.
