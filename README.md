# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
## Project Objectives
"Change to past tense when it is done"
1. Developing a customer churn prediction python notebook.
2. Running a Auto-Machine Learning model using H20 and comparing the results from the python notebook.
3. Testing casual inference on following predictors: gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, PhoneService, and PaperlessBilling by applying Microsoft DoWhy pakacage.             
4. Building a model interpretability and explainability analysis using SHAP pakacage.
5. Generating a ML bias report based on the SHAR analysis to suggest further managerial actions.

## Churn Prediction Modeling
Model Work Flow:
1. get data and descriptive stats
2. data visualization 
3. train a model:
    1) Regression;
    2) ANN;
    3) Random Forest;
    ...
4. select model and further tune
5. Extra
    1) building a pipeline
